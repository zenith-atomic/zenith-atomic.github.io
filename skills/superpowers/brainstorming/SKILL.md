# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.
Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"
Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them.

## Checklist
1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic involves visual questions) — own message, not combined with other content
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
7. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, scope
8. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review before proceeding
9. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill

## Process Flow
1. Explore project context
2. Visual questions ahead? → Offer Visual Companion (own message, no other content)
3. Ask clarifying questions (one at a time)
4. Propose 2-3 approaches
5. Present design sections → user approves?
6. Write design doc → spec self-review (fix inline)
7. User reviews spec?
8. Invoke writing-plans skill

## Design for Isolation
- Break into smaller units with one clear purpose
- Well-defined interfaces between units
- Each unit testable independently
- Smaller, well-bounded units are easier to work with

## After the Design
- Write spec to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git
- Ask user to review before proceeding

## Key Principles
- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
